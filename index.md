PostDoc at the University "G. d'Annunzio", Chieti-Pescara, Italy

Short bio

I am a PostDoc in Statistics at the University "G. d'Annunzio" of Chieti-Pescara (IT), where I focus on spatial statistical modelling combined with participatory processes aimed at decision-making.  
I obtained my PhD at the University College Dublin (IRL), where my thesis focused on the development of an open-source platform (RT-GSCS) capable of collecting, organizing, and representing expert spatial opinions in real-time, using Delphi methods, scenario methods, and computational and statistical algorithms.
I am a member of several national and international projects, and I have lectured in various university courses, including Quantitative Methods for Social Forecasting, Introduction to GIS, and Geographical Information Systems for Policy and Planning.
I am the author of several scientific articles published in scientific journals, and I have participated in various international conferences, where in 2022, I won the Best Presentation Young Statisticians Meeting Prize, 2022, awarded by the Royal Statistical Society.
I am the founder of the "Real-Time Geo-Spatial Consensus System", which received the Next Generation Foresight Practitioners Award from the School of International Futures in 2022.
