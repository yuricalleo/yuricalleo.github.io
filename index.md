PostDoc at the University "G. d'Annunzio", Chieti-Pescara, Italy

**Short bio**

<p align="justify">
I am a PostDoc in Statistics at the University “G. d’Annunzio” of Chieti-Pescara (IT), working on spatial statistical modelling and participatory processes for decision-making. I earned my PhD at University College Dublin (IRL), developing the open-source platform RT-GSCS to collect and analyze expert spatial opinions in real time. I have lectured on quantitative methods and GIS, contributed to national and international projects, and authored several scientific articles. In 2022, I received the Royal Statistical Society’s Best Presentation Prize (Young Statisticians Meeting) and the Next Generation Foresight Practitioners Award for founding the “Real-Time Geo-Spatial Consensus System.”
